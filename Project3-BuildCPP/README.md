### Project #3
Build some C++ code
* Make a helloWorld.cpp file
* Write a script to build and run it  
Phase 2: make the shell script take an option for whether to build, test, or clean (remove the binary)    
Phase 3: make the script have an “install” option that’ll copy the binary to your home directory/bin/ dir  
    - If the directory doesn't exist, create it (if [ ! -d dir ])
